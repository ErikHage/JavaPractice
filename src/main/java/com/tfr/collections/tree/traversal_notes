Breadth-First Traversal

    if(root is not null) {
        queue.enqueue(root)
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            node = queue.dequeue()
            visit node
            enqueue the children of node (from left to right) into queue
        }
    }


Depth-First Traversal

    Instantiate a stack of nodes
    if(root is not null) {
        stack.push(root)
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            node = stack,top()
            stack.pop()
            visit node
            push the children of node (from right to left) onto stack
        }
    }

Iteration types
    PreOrder = visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree
    InOrder = visit left subtree, visit root, visit right subtree
    PostOrder = visit left subtree, visit right subtree, visit root (good for deleting entire tree node by node)
